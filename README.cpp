/*
c++ primter 5th edition

This is the home directory of this journal. Within this journal you 
will find many folder with the format of dates. These dates represents
when I wrote them i.e when I read the chapter. Becuase I am familiar
with c++ already I may not right entry for dates I read for the reason
that they are basic knowledge or I am pretty familiar with what is being
thought in that chapter/section.

For this reason I will also skip excersis that are to easy. Some might
be easy but because I am not familiar with them I may still choose to 
write them for future reference.

I am already pretty familiar with c++09 as it was my first programming
language I officially learned to use. Some errors in my knowledge include
jumping to different versions of cpp from c++98 - c++20. This is one of
the reasons I have decided to relearn cpp.

The main reason why I choose to read c++ primer is because I want to fill
in the gaps in my knowledge of cpp. I am already familiar with writting
it but in communicating the language can be a challange. This is because
I leared to program in cpp in 4 different methods (university professors,
textbook, youtube, and horrible online homework problems from college).

My goal in reading this book is improve as a programmer. Become a more
complete and efficient cpp programmer. Be able to communicate the language
at a higher level. Become a more valuabvle asset to organizations that
recruiters come to me.
