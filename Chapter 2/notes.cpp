/**
 * Chapter 1 was the basics of cpp. loops and conditions for failures
 * 
 * One of the things that intrigdme in this chapter was the way the of streaming
 * data from the buffer straight from the function.
 * Normally I would define these conditions outside the header class but the
 * Sales_item.h would parse the data as soon as the constructor was created.
 * The method I was thought was to create the constructor and the call its methods.
 * Usually I would call the main method of the constructor that would handle everything
 * handled in the Sales_item class but these method is one I didnt know of.
 * 
 * I kinda understand how its parsing data from the buffer as the constructor
 * but I hope to learn more in chapter 7 as it states in the code.
